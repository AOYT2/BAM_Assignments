# BAM Assignments
This repository consists of assignments completed during my Master's in Business Analytics and Management and Minor in Artificial Intelligence.

* `Data Wrangling Assignments` has two different assignments which focus on data preparation, cleaning, and exploration
* `Gurobi Assignment` has three separate assignments that use Gurobi to optimize logistics problems
* `Supply Chain Assignment` uses two data sources to investigate their relationships and give the company advice (the data of the company used is fabricated for this assignment)
* `Assignment Without Codes` had multiple assignments' reports with various different purposes such as database organization and statistical analyses

Much of the group assignments were done together with Lieke, Martijn, and Thirza.
